# NOTE: Itâ€™s important to map the registered task name to the pipeline name in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/utils/update_metadata.py.
# This will streamline using inferred task names and make exporting models to Hugging Face pipelines easier.

    """
    Loads a seq2seq language model for conditional text generation and registers it under the task
    'fill-mask' using Hugging Face's `AutoModelForMaskedLM`.

    Args:
        model_name_or_path (str):
            Model ID on huggingface.co or path on disk to the model repository to export. For example:
            `model_name_or_path="google-bert/bert-base-uncased"` or `mode_name_or_path="/path/to/model_folder`
        **kwargs:
            Additional configuration options for the model.

    Returns:
        transformers.PreTrainedModel:
            An instance of a model subclass (e.g., BERT) with the configuration for exporting
            and lowering to ExecuTorch.
