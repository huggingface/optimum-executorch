    Export a pre-trained PyTorch model to the ExecuTorch format using a specified recipe.

    This function facilitates the transformation of a PyTorch model into an optimized ExecuTorch program.

    Args:
        model (`Union["PreTrainedModel", "TorchExportableModuleWithStaticCache"]`):
            A PyTorch model to be exported. This can be a standard HuggingFace `PreTrainedModel` or a wrapped
            module like `TorchExportableModuleWithStaticCache` for text generation task.
        task (`str`):
            The specific task the exported model will perform, e.g., "text-generation".
        recipe (`str`):
            The recipe to guide the export process, e.g., "xnnpack". Recipes define the optimization and lowering steps.
            Will raise an exception if the specified recipe is not registered in the recipe registry.
        output_dir (`Union[str, Path]`):
            Path to the directory where the resulting ExecuTorch model will be saved.
        **kwargs:
            Additional configuration options passed to the recipe.

    Returns:
        `ExecuTorchProgram`:
            The lowered ExecuTorch program object.

    Notes:
        - The function uses a dynamic recipe discovery mechanism to identify and import the specified recipe.
        - The exported model is stored in the specified output directory with the fixed filename `model.pte`.
        - The resulting ExecuTorch program is serialized and saved to the output directory.
