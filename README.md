# ü§ó Optimum ExecuTorch

**Optimize and deploy Hugging Face models with ExecuTorch**

[Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index) | [ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch) | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

</div>

## üìã Overview

Optimum ExecuTorch enables efficient deployment of transformer models using Meta's ExecuTorch framework. It provides:
- üîÑ Easy conversion of Hugging Face models to ExecuTorch format
- ‚ö° Optimized inference with hardware-specific optimizations
- ü§ù Seamless integration with Hugging Face Transformers
- üì± Efficient deployment on various devices

## ‚ö° Quick Installation

### 1. Create a virtual environment
Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) on your machine. Then, create a virtual environment to manage our dependencies.
```
conda create -n optimum-executorch python=3.11
conda activate optimum-executorch
```

### 2. Install optimum-executorch from source
```
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-executorch.git
cd optimum-executorch
pip install '.[dev]'
```

- üîú Install from pypi coming soon...

### 3. Install dependencies in dev mode

To access every available optimization and experiment with the newest features, run:
```
python install_dev.py
```

This script will install `executorch`, `torch`, `torchao`, `transformers`, etc. from nightly builds or from source to access the latest models and optimizations.

To leave an existing ExecuTorch installation untouched, run `install_dev.py` with `--skip_override_torch` to prevent it from being overwritten.

## üéØ Quick Start

There are two ways to use Optimum ExecuTorch:

### Option 1: Export and Load in One Python API
```python
from optimum.executorch import ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load and export the model on-the-fly
model_id = "HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct"
model = ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    recipe="xnnpack",
    attn_implementation="custom_sdpa",  # Use custom SDPA implementation for better performance
    use_custom_kv_cache=True,  # Use custom KV cache for better performance
    **{"qlinear": "8da4w", "qembedding": "8w"},  # Quantize linear and embedding layers
)

# Generate text right away
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
generated_text = model.text_generation(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    prompt="Once upon a time",
    max_seq_len=128,
)
print(generated_text)
```

> **Note:** If an ExecuTorch model is already cached on the Hugging Face Hub, the API will automatically skip the export step and load the cached `.pte` file. To test this, replace the `model_id` in the example above with `"executorch-community/SmolLM2-135M"`, where the `.pte` file is pre-cached. Additionally, the `.pte` file can be directly associated with the eager model, as demonstrated in this [example](https://huggingface.co/optimum-internal-testing/tiny-random-llama/tree/executorch).


### Option 2: Export and Load Separately

#### Step 1: Export your model
Use the CLI tool to convert your model to ExecuTorch format:
```
optimum-cli export executorch \
    --model "HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct" \
    --task "text-generation" \
    --recipe "xnnpack" \
    --use_custom_sdpa \
    --use_custom_kv_cache \
    --qlinear 8da4w \
    --qembedding 8w \
    --output_dir="hf_smollm2"
```
Explore the various export options by running the command: `optimum-cli export executorch --help`

#### Step 2: Validate the Exported Model on Host Using the Python API
Use the exported model for text generation:
```python
from optimum.executorch import ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the exported model
model = ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./hf_smollm2")

# Initialize tokenizer and generate text
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct")
generated_text = model.text_generation(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    prompt="Once upon a time",
    max_seq_len=128
)
print(generated_text)
```

#### Step 3: Run inference on-device
To perform on-device inference, you can use ExecuTorch‚Äôs sample runner or the example iOS/Android applications. For detailed instructions, refer to the [ExecuTorch Sample Runner guide](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/main/examples/models/qwen3/README.md#example-run).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Supported Optimizations

### Custom Operators
Supported using [**custom SDPA**](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/a4322c71c3a97e79e0454a8223db214b010f1193/extension/llm/README.md?plain=1#L40) with Hugging Face Transformers, boosting performance by **3x** compared to default SDPA, based on tests with `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M`.

Supported using **custom KV cache** that performs in-place cache update, boosting performance by **2.5x** compared to default static KV cache, based on tests with `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M`.

### Backends Delegation
Currently, **Optimum-ExecuTorch** supports the [XNNPACK Backend](https://pytorch.org/executorch/main/backends-xnnpack.html) with [custom SDPA](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/blob/a4322c71c3a97e79e0454a8223db214b010f1193/extension/llm/README.md?plain=1#L40) for efficient execution on mobile CPUs.

For a comprehensive overview of all backends supported by ExecuTorch, please refer to the [ExecuTorch Backend Overview](https://pytorch.org/executorch/main/backends-overview.html).

### Quantization
We currently support Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for linear layers using int8 dynamic per-token activations and int4 grouped per-channel weights (aka `8da4w`), as well as int8 channelwise embedding quantization.

### Batch Prefill

Batch prefill is supported now, improving the time to first generated token 20x faster by allowing prompt tokens to be processed simultaneously.

The following models have been successfully tested with Executorch. For details on the specific optimizations supported and how to use them for each model, please consult their respective test files in the [`tests/models/`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-executorch/tree/main/tests/models) directory.
