# ü§ó Optimum ExecuTorch

**Optimize and deploy Hugging Face models with ExecuTorch**

[Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/index) | [ExecuTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch) | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

</div>

## üöÄ Overview

Optimum ExecuTorch enables efficient deployment of transformer models using Meta's ExecuTorch framework. It provides:
- üîÑ Easy conversion of Hugging Face models to ExecuTorch format
- ‚ö° Optimized inference with hardware-specific optimizations
- ü§ù Seamless integration with Hugging Face Transformers
- üì± Efficient deployment on various devices

## ‚ö° Quick Installation

### 1. Create a virtual environment
Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) on your machine. Then, create a virtual environment to manage our dependencies.
```
conda create -n optimum-executorch python=3.11
conda activate optimum-executorch
```

### 2. Install optimum-executorch from source
```
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-executorch.git
cd optimum-executorch
pip install '.[tests]'
```

- üîú Install from pypi coming soon...

### [Optional] 3. Install dependencies in dev mode
You can install `executorch` and `transformers` from source, where you can access new ExecuTorch
compatilbe models from `transformers` and new features from `executorch` as both repos are under
rapid deployment.

Follow these steps manually:

#### 3.1. Clone and Install ExecuTorch from Source
From the root directory where `optimum-executorch` is cloned:
```
# Clone the ExecuTorch repository
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
cd executorch
# Checkout the stable branch to ensure stability
git checkout viable/strict
# Install ExecuTorch
python ./install_executorch.py
cd ..
```

#### 3.2. Clone and Install Transformers from Source
From the root directory where `optimum-executorch` is cloned:
```
# Clone the Transformers repository
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
# Install Transformers in editable mode
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

## üéØ Quick Start

There are two ways to use Optimum ExecuTorch:

### Option 1: Export and Load in One Python API
```python
from optimum.executorch import ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load and export the model on-the-fly
model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"
model = ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, recipe="xnnpack")

# Generate text right away
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
generated_text = model.text_generation(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    prompt="Simply put, the theory of relativity states that",
    max_seq_len=128
)
print(generated_text)
```

> **Note:** If an ExecuTorch model is already cached on the Hugging Face Hub, the API will automatically skip the export step and load the cached `.pte` file. To test this, replace the `model_id` in the example above with `"executorch-community/SmolLM2-135M"`, where the `.pte` file is pre-cached. Additionally, the `.pte` file can be directly associated with the eager model, as demonstrated in this [example](https://huggingface.co/optimum-internal-testing/tiny-random-llama/tree/executorch).


### Option 2: Export and Load Separately

#### Step 1: Export your model
Use the CLI tool to convert your model to ExecuTorch format:
```
optimum-cli export executorch \
    --model "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B" \
    --task "text-generation" \
    --recipe "xnnpack" \
    --output_dir="meta_llama3_2_1b"
```

#### Step 2: Load and run inference
Use the exported model for text generation:
```python
from optimum.executorch import ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load the exported model
model = ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("./meta_llama3_2_1b")

# Initialize tokenizer and generate text
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B")
generated_text = model.text_generation(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    prompt="Simply put, the theory of relativity states that",
    max_seq_len=128
)
print(generated_text)
```
