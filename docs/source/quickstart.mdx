## Export

You can export your ðŸ¤— Transformers models to ExecuTorch easily:

```bash
optimum-cli export executorch --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B --recipe xnnpack --output_dir meta_llama3_2_1b_executorch
```


## Inference

To load a model and run inference, you can just replace your `AutoModelForCausalLM` class with the corresponding `ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM` class. You can also load a PyTorch checkpoint and convert it to ExecuTorch on-the-fly when loading your model.

```diff
- from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
+ from optimum.executorch import ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer

  model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B" # you can also load the model that was exported with the CLI
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
- model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
+ model = ExecuTorchModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
```
